# Maven Login Application

The object of this project was to create a Spring application with Maven and a Servlet to handle the HTTP requests. The application takes in a JSON object with a username and password, authenticates the user and sends back the appropriate response status code. I learned how to create a Spring application with Maven to handle dependencies and how to create a Servlet.
